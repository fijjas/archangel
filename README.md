AI-powered personal safety monitoring system that keeps you informed about threats, legal changes, and security incidents relevant to your specific situation.

## üéØ Features

- **Natural Language Interface** - Just talk to the bot in your own words
- **Personalized Alerts** - Only get notifications relevant to YOUR situation
- **Multi-language Support** - Automatically detects and responds in your language
- **Dynamic Profiling** - AI extracts safety-relevant information from your description
- **News Monitoring** - Tracks trusted independent sources
- **Cyber Security** - Monitor vulnerabilities in your software stack
- **No Commands** - AI understands intent from natural conversation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Telegram Bot Token (get from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Claude API Key (get from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fijjas/archangel.git
cd archangel
```

2. Copy environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit `.env` and add your credentials:
```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=strong_password_here
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Check logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f api
```

## üì± Usage

1. Start chat with your bot on Telegram
2. Send `/start`
3. Describe yourself in natural language:

```
I'm Alex, 28, living in Berlin.
US citizen, software engineer at a startup.
Have work visa until 2026.
Using MacBook, iPhone, Node.js and React.
```

4. The bot will:
   - Extract your profile information
   - Discover relevant news sources
   - Start monitoring for personalized alerts
   - Notify you of any relevant threats

## ü§ñ What You Can Do

Just write naturally - the AI understands:

- **Update profile**: "I moved to Paris" or "I'm now a journalist"
- **Change language**: "Switch to YOUR-LANGUAGE"
- **Add news source**: "Track NEWS-SOURCE" or "Add NEWS-SOURCE"
- **Remove source**: "Stop tracking NEWS-SOURCE" or "Remove NEWS-SOURCE"
- **Check now**: "Check safety now" or "Any alerts?"
- **Show alerts**: "What's happening?" or "Show my alerts"
- **Show sources**: "What sources do you monitor?"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
Telegram Bot (Polling)
      ‚Üì
Natural Language Processing (Claude)
      ‚Üì
Redis (Profiles, Sources, Alerts)
      ‚Üì
PostgreSQL (Users, History)
      ‚Üì
Daily Safety Check (Cron)
```

## üìä Data Storage

- **PostgreSQL**: Minimal user data (ID, language, timestamps)
- **Redis**: Everything else (profiles, sources, alerts, locks)
- **TTL**: Alerts expire after 24 hours

## üîê Security

- All credentials in `.env` (not committed)
- Redis lock prevents concurrent checks
- No personal data in SQL (only Redis)
- All communication via Telegram's encryption

## üåç Multi-language

Language is auto-detected from user's first message.

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

Per user/month:
- Claude API: ~$2.50
- Infrastructure: $0 (self-hosted)
- **Total: ~$2.50/user/month**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd api
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```
